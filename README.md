### TarkovKitGenerator
#### TarkovKitGenerator is a Python web app built with Dash and hosted with www.pythonanywhere.com. This app acts like a simple toolbelt for Escape from Tarkov players. It includes tools like random loadout generators with the option of selecting a random map, and crafting/upgrade information for all stations in the Hideout. This tool can help a player in game and can also provide some fun raids with the random kit generator.
